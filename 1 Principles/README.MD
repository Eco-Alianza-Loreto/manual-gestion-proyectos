# 1 Overview
The purpose of the Principles is to ensure that a project maintains high standards of effectiveness and ethics. There are 7 PMWC principles (adapted from [2]). Following these principles ensures that the purpose of a project is never lost (Continued conservation justification), a project focuses more on what it aims to achieve rather than how it will achieve it (Focus on results), unwanted results are eliminated or reduced (Do no harm), everyone on a project team knows what they and each other are meant to do (Knowing who does what), a project does not get out of control (Controlled progress), a project can adapt to changing circumstances (Informed adaptation), and the PMWC approach is tailored to meet a project's needs (Fit for purpose) [1]. Guidance on how the Principles can be tailored is outlined in Box 4.

# 2 Continued conservation justification

## 2.1 Purpose
The Continued conservation justification principle is used to ensure that a project’s results are always directly linked to wildlife conservation, and that the results are contributing to the conservation results the organisation wants to achieve. This principle helps project teams to avoid drifting into more human development or business focused work, or otherwise becoming independent of their parent organisation and programme.

## 2.2 Application
In order for a project to start, the project’s desired results and objectives must be in line with an organisation’s Programme plan. The project’s results also must always be directly linked to a specific scope and defined biological targets. The project’s alignment with the Programme plan is documented in the Project plan (see Documents), and checked during the project’s life cycle through the Managing progress process. If at any stage the project no longer has conservation justification, then the project should be re-aligned or closed. For example, a project, working under a Programme plan to improve the status of biodiversity that drifted into a focus on improving child literacy, would be in breach of the Continued conservation justification principle.

#3 Focus on results

##3.1 Purpose
The Focus on results principle is used to ensure that project teams place more importance on what they are trying to achieve (results), rather than on how they are trying to achieve it (work packages). This principle is to help project teams avoid continual spending of resources on work packages that are not achieving the desired results, and instead to seek out the quickest and most cost-effective means of achieving desired results.

## 3.2 Application
The Focus on results principle is applied by a clear definition of the desired results in the Project plan, together with the objectives and associated indicators used to evaluate when each result has been achieved (see Documents). Progress towards achieving the desired results is then tracked through the Managing progress process. If the project’s results are in danger of not being achieved within the schedule and budget parameters outlined in the Project plan, then the Project plan is either updated or the project is closed (see Managing risks and issues processes). Under this principle, a project has failed if it has delivered all of the work packages but not achieved the desired results outlined in the Project plan. Conversely, a project has succeeded if the results have been achieved despite major changes to some or all of the work packages outlined in the original Project plan. For example, a project that delivered online training in law enforcement to a government’s forest department staff would have failed if that work package did not achieve the desired result of an improvement in law enforcement skill levels for those forest department staff.

# 4 Do no harm

## 4.1 Purpose
In the process of achieving results that benefit wildlife, projects may inadvertently risk contributing to the suffering of other wildlife or humans. While avoiding all negative impacts of a project may not be possible, the Do no harm principle is in place to make sure a project team considers and incorporates means to minimise such adverse effects.

## 4.2 Application
The Do no harm principle is applied in the PMWC approach by describing the possible negative effects to humans or wildlife, and documenting the corresponding actions to minimise those effects in the Project plan. If, at any stage, a project’s positive results are judged by the project team to be outweighed by the project’s negative results, then the project should be closed. For example, a project must decide whether or not to proceed if a planned increase in the protection levels for a national park will inadvertently reduce access of local communities to natural resources and prevent expression of traditional cultural hunting practices.

# 5 Knowing who does what

##5.1 Purpose
The Knowing who does what principle is to ensure that everyone within the project knows what they are meant to decide upon and do. Following this principle means that team members’ time, expertise, and level of authority are used effectively, which in turn leads to speedier decision-making and work package completion.

## 5.2 Application
The Knowing who does what principle is achieved by the project having a well-structured team and clear roles and responsibilities for every team member, which are well communicated, understood, respected, and acted upon across the team. This principle is applied through designation of roles and line management in the Project plan and adherence to role responsibilities outlined in the Roles, Phases, Control processes, and Administrative processes. A project applying the Knowing who does what principle, for example, would not be delayed by requiring the Executive’s time to decide upon what speaker to hire for an awareness event, or which design to use for a campaign poster. Likewise, it would be clear which team member was responsible if a project managed to complete a series of awareness events ahead of schedule and under budget.

# 6 Controlled progress

## 6.1 Purpose
The Controlled progress principle is used to ensure that the project does not get out of control and proceed without achieving its desired results, or spend unacceptable amounts of time or budget to achieve those results.

## 6.2 Application
The Controlled progress principle is applied through the Managing progress and Managing risks and issues processes. These processes require reporting on project progress at regular intervals, and dealing with risks and issues as they arise to ensure delivery of the results, schedule, and budget outlined in the Project plan. Under the Controlled progress principle, for example, a project to decrease planting of exotic plants in private areas bordering a national park would not be allowed to continue if achieving that result was likely to be twice as long as the Project plan deemed tolerable.

# 7 Informed adaptation

## 7.1 Purpose
The Informed adaptation principle is used to enable and encourage a project to adapt to changing conditions over the course of its life cycle, to increase the chances of a project achieving its desired results.

## 7.2 Application
The Informed adaptation principle is achieved through actively identifying, monitoring, documenting, and responding to new information, situations, or lessons as they arise. This principle is applied in the PMWC approach through the development of the initial Project plan, and the subsequent monitoring and adaptation of that Project plan throughout the Managing lessons learned and Managing risks and issues processes. Under this principle, for example, if a project finds out that a previous awareness campaign in a particular village was blocked by local leaders, then that project could adjust the Project plan to include additional milestones to identify and overcome the local leaders’ concerns.

# 8 Fit for purpose

## 8.1 Purpose
The Fit for purpose principle is used to make sure the PMWC approach is adapted in a way to suit the scale, complexity, importance, and risk level of a particular project (Box 4). Not following this principle may lead to project failure or inefficiencies, because the project management approach is inappropriate for the project in question.

## 8.2 Application
The Fit for purpose principle is applied by altering the PMWC approach to suit the needs of the project in question, following the tailoring guidelines for each component. The tailoring guidelines contain limits set to ensure adherence to the PMWC principles. Too light a use of the Control processes, for example, will not put in place sufficient controls to deal with risks and issues that will otherwise imperil a project’s results or cause it to run over schedule and budget. This will cause the project to fail to meet the Controlled progress principle. Conversely, Control processes applied too heavily to a particular project will waste time and money implementing inappropriate levels of control that hinder, rather than support, the achievement of project results. For example, a low risk, low budget project may tailor the PMWC approach to carry out fewer status meetings to monitor progress.
