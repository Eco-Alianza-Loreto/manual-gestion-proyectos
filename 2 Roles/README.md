# 1 Overview
The purpose of designating roles is to facilitate clear decision-making, efficient project control, team cohesion, and individual job satisfaction. All project staff are defined in terms of roles. A role is different to a post or position in that multiple roles may be assigned to a single post or position in an organisation [Box 5].

> Box 5. Operations.
The term Operations refers to the operational departments within the organisation which perform functions such as human resource management, finance, administrative, communications, and fundraising.

There are both internal and external roles on a project. Internal roles are those assigned to staff employed by the organisation responsible for delivering the project. The internal roles on the project may be filled by existing or newly- hired staff. External roles are those assigned to staff which the organisation engages to secure any additional expertise or funds required to deliver the project. Although referred to throughout the document, the role of Operations (Box 5) is not listed in this section as Operations roles tend to be filled by staff from support departments within the organisation, rather than roles within a project. Internal, external, and Operations roles can, however, all be considered as stakeholders in a project (Box 6).

> Box 6. Stakeholders.
Stakeholders can be considered to be anyone who can affect or will be affected by the projectâ€™s objectives [8]. For example, stakeholders can include employees, donors, government agencies, community groups, and other conservation organisations.
Stakeholders are identified through assigning roles, and identifying groups through development of the situation analysis and theory of change sections of the Project plan (see Documents). It is up to the project team to decide if and how to interact stakeholders during each project phase (see Phases).

Some project roles have particular accountabilities and responsibilities related to the organisation, programme, project, or work package level (Box 7, Figure 7). In addition, each role has specific line management responsibilities for each project phase (Box 8, Figure 8 and Figure 9).

> Box 7. Accountable and responsible.
Accountable: The person who makes the final decision in a given situation, or who has sign off authority on a document [8].
Responsible: The person responsible for doing the day-to-day work to manage or carry out particular activities [8].

This roles section describes each role and what they are accountable and responsible for. Additional details are also provided regarding when each role starts and finishes on the project (Figure 10), how many of each role might be expected on a project, and notes on any instances where different roles may or may not be assigned to the same person.
More detailed responsibilities relating to the Phases, Administrative processes, and Control processes are described in those components. Guidance on how the Roles can be tailored is outlined in Box 12

> Box 8. Line management.
Line management describes who each role is directly managed by, in terms of taking instructions from and reporting to [2].
